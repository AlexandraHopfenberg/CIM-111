There's a tennis center, golf course and dog park, too. Haulover Beach is also the host of a stretch of clothing optional beach. So, if you forgot to pack a suit- no problem! Or, if you're looking to get some sun without any tan lines, well, this is the place for you. There are beach wheelchairs for rent at Haulover Beach Park. Pedestrian tunnels link to the park and marina on Biscayne Bay. Nine-hole golf course, tennis courts, kite flying area and kite shop. Parking is not free.</p>
